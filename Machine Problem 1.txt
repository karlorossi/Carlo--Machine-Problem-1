Write a C++ program that will ask for the following input from the user:
	Student Name:
Program/Course:
	Year Level: (should be integer type)
	Number of Units Enrolled: (should be double or float data type)
Determine the corresponding year name of the student and rate per unit as follows:
	Year Level		Year Name		Rate Per Unit
		1		Freshman		1,500
		2		Sophomore		1,800
		3		Junior			2,000
	        4 or 5		Senior			2,300
Compute the tuition fee as follows:
	Tuition fee = no. of units enrolled X rate per unit
	Down payment = 30% of the tuition fee
	Balance = tuition fee â€“ down payment
Assume that the user will not enter an invalid value.

Sample Input:
	Student Name	: Maria Blanco
	Program/Course	: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
	Year Level		: 4	
	No. of Units		: 16
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Output:
			ENROLLMENT SLIP
	Student Name	: Maria Blanco
	Program/Course	: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
	Year Name		: Senior	
	No. of Units		: 16
	Tuition Fee		: 36800
	Down Payment	: 11040
	Balance		: 25760
